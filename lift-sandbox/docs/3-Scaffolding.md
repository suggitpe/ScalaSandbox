# Add scaffolding to the application

Do we need application scaffolding? Not really but to be honest with you if you don't use it you will forevermore be plumbing in the same boiler plate code.  So to my mind we are probably well advised to use it, at least initially until you find incompatable use cases.

Generally Lift has two types of application scaffolfing:
 + Prototype traits
 + CRUDify

## 1. Prototype traits

## 2. CRUDify
